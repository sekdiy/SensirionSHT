# SensirionSHT
An Arduino library for Sensirion SHT temperature and humidity sensors.

Provides a non-blocking interface to Sensirion SHT1x sensors and compatible (see: http://www.sensirion.com/en/products/humidity-temperature).

This library extends (and thus requires) the library "Sensirion" by Markus Schatzl and Carl Jackson (see: http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Sensirion).

The documentation uses Doxygen (https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) and includes adaptions by Velron (https://github.com/Velron/doxygen-bootstrapped).
