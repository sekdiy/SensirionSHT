/**
 * Sensirion SHT library
 *
 * This class provides non-blocking access to Sensirion SHT series temperature/humidity sensors (SHT1x and compatible).
 *
 * An SHT sensor connected to 'dataPin' and 'clockPin' (see sensor documentation) is polled every 'period' (default: 3s).
 *
 * The dedicated method 'tick(float duration)' has to be called periodically (e.g. every second) in order to update the values.

     * A measurement cycle consists of an initial temperature measurement and a followup humidity measurement.
     * For timing and accuracy information please see the documentation of your sensor.
     *
     * Once a period is completed, a new measurement cycle is started.
     * As soon as a measurement result is available, the temperature value is stored and the humidity value is requested.
     * Once the humidity value becomes available and has been stored too, the values are marked as fresh and we're ready for the next cycle.
     *
     * Call this method periodically and always provide the tick duration (time elapsed since the last call).
     *
     * @param   duration        The duration of the current tick period (in seconds).
     * @return  An error value according to the definitions in the Sensirion library (i.e. 0 on succes).
